# Arduino HID rickroll

How to use it:
- OPTIONAL: Change the mp3 file in rickroll.vbs (line 5). If you do this, you'll have to change the rickroll.vbs download link in arduino-hid-rickroll.ino (line 31)
- Uncomment either line 40 or line 49 to 49 (depending on if your Arduino has a button soldered on it or not)
- Upload the code to your Arduino.
- ???
- Profit!

I also included the duckyscript version in case you're using a rubber ducky.
